# CurrencyConverter-V.2
My second, slightly more advanced, currency converter. Still uses Java but this time I learned how to use an API to get real time conversion rates between 161 currencies. 

*HOW TO USE*
Same as the first version, follow the prompt chose between which currencies you wish to convert to and from or write in your own with the 'Other' option and let the program show you the rate and quantity.
